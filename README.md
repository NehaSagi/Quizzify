This is my first javascript project.Even though it is a simple quiz project , it helped me learn a lot of things.
About project : Output screen shows question one by one , for each question user should enter his/her preferred answer , and the output screen shows if it is correct or wrong answer.
At the end , output screen shows whole score and leader board.
